              <h5>Started</h5>
              <p>
                In 1997, Pastor Vidal and Pastora Rhoda Day Carag were sent to Trece Martires City, Cavite, where they began the work of the Lord by holding Sunday services in their own home, with only their family members attending – the pastoral couple and their two children.

              <h5>Thriving</h5>
              <p>
                Today, FISHGEN Trece is a strong and thriving congregation, considered a blessing to the community for its continued and passionate sharing of God’s Word in schools, universities, offices, and even among the police force.

              <p>By God’s grace and faithfulness, the ministry of Pastor Vidal and Pastora Rhoda has also borne fruit – establishing one FG branch (FISHGEN Osorio) and three outreaches located in Santiago and San Francisco, General Trias, and Silang, Cavite.</p>
